Recent advances in video generation raise hopes that these models possess world modeling capabilities. 
We introduce <em>Morpheus</em>, a benchmark of 80 real-world videos for evaluating whether generative models respect physical conservation laws. 
Using physics-informed metrics, we find that while modern models generate visually appealing videos, they struggle to encode fundamental physical principles.
