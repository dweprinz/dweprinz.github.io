I'm working on a range of projects throughout the year.


## Responsible AI at the Dutch Police
I'm very interested in AI in possible high-risk settings, such as policing, defense, healthcare and education. At my job, responsible AI is one of my main topics of interest. My focus is on integrating responsible AI in the MLOps lifecycle, so development is responsible by design. I'm reading as much blogs and papers as I can to stay up-to-date. 

## AI Safety research
I have participated in the AGI Safety Fundamentals programme 2023, where I explored AI safety research with fellow interested students. I am currently a member of AI Safety Amsterdam ([AISA](https://aisafetyamsterdam.com/)). Firstly, I participated in an AI Safety Hackathon in Delft. In addition, I'm gaining experience in the research field. Right now, I am participating in the Supervised Program for Alignment Research (SPAR). Here, I work on extending the AI Control paper from Redwood Research.

## Conformal Prediction
[My thesis](/assets/share/BScThesis_DerckPrinzhorn.pdf) ([code](https://github.com/dweprinz/Benchmarking-conformal-prediction-methods-for-time-series-regression)) benchmarked various adaptive conformal prediction methods for time series. In November 2023, I even won the AmsterdamAI Thesis Award 2023! I had the pleasure to be supervised by [Alexander Timans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-timans/) who introduced me to the topic of uncertainty quantification (UQ). Also supervised by [Alexander Timans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-timans/), I have published my first paper on this topic at [COPA2024](https://copa-conference.com).

## Medical AI
During my MSc program I encountered the field of medical AI. Earlier, I have thought about the use of AI for curing tinnitus, but did not have the knowledge to pursue this. Now, I am learning more about the field and I am working on a project related to radiotherapy. In the future, I would like to work on AI for curing tinnitus.

## AI for Education
I believe that education should be accessible for everyone. There are companies trying to improve the educational system for example by open-source content, or by the use of webapplications and accelerating processes. In universities, grading is partially automated and digital exercises allow for horizontal grading. There is also a lot of research on the use of AI for education, especially in Chinese settings. However, I have not seen a major breakthrough in education yet. I think this is because none of the initiatives found the right balance between a productive and trustworthy platform while also innovating the platform with AI. Popular tools often have no scalable architecture.

Therefore, I'm exploring educational improvements by the use of AI, with a strong focus on responsible AI architecture.
