I'm working on a range of projects throughout the year.

## Responsible AI at the Dutch Police
I'm very interested in AI in possible high-risk settings, such as policing, defense, healthcare and education. At my job, responsible AI is one of my main topics of interest. My focus is on integrating responsible AI in the MLOps lifecycle, so development is responsible by design. I'm reading as much blogs and papers as I can to stay up-to-date. 

## AI Safety research
I have participated in the AGI Safety Fundamentals programme 2023, where I explored AI safety research with fellow interested students. I am currently a member of the recently founded AI Safety Initiative Amsterdam ([AISIA](https://aisafetyamsterdam.com/)). Recently I participated in an AI Safety Hackathon in Delft. My focus is on operationalizing AISIA and therefore being more effective as a community. In addition, I'm gaining experience in the research field.

## Conformal Prediction
[My thesis](/assets/share/BScThesis_DerckPrinzhorn.pdf) ([code](https://github.com/dweprinz/Benchmarking-conformal-prediction-methods-for-time-series-regression)) benchmarked various adaptive conformal prediction methods for time series. In November 2023, I even won the AmsterdamAI Thesis Award 2023! I had the pleasure to be supervised by [Alexander Timans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-timans/) who introduced me to the topic of uncertainty quantification (UQ). I'm very interested in reliability through UQ and currently working on two other research projects related to conformal prediction.

## Reinforcement learning for robotics
After the covid pandemic, together with friends I renewed the robotics soccer student team. I operated as project manager and created vision and an operational plan to reach our goals. We now have a very ambitious team which has seen explosive growth, increasing 6x in size. Currently, I'm more focused on the foundation board tasks and reinforcement learning (RL). We are working on making simulated RL generalizable to real robot soccer. More information can be found at our website [www.dutchnaoteam.nl](https://dutchnaoteam.nl). We are looking for partners that support us in our mission to innovate in the robotics community and educate students about AI and robotics!

## AI for Education
I believe that education should be accessible for everyone. There are companies trying to improve the educational system for example by open-source content, or by the use of webapplications and accelerating processes. In universities, grading is partially automated and digital exercises allow for horizontal grading. There is also a lot of research on the use of AI for education, especially in Chinese settings. However, I have not seen a major breakthrough in education yet. I think this is because none of the initiatives found the right balance between a productive and trustworthy platform while also innovating the platform with AI. Popular tools often have no scalable architecture.

Therefore, I'm doing research on educational improvements by the use of AI, with a strong focus on responsible AI architecture.
