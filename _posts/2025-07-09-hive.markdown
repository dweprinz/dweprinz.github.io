We present <em>HIVE</em>, an interactive dashboard for exploring and interpreting hyperbolic embeddings in deep learning. 
HIVE offers Poincaré projections, custom dimensionality reduction, and four interaction modes (comparison, traversal, tree, neighbors). 
A user study shows that HIVE supports practical analysis of hierarchical structure, with potential applications in reinforcement learning and graph discovery.
