Hi, welcome to my website!

# Current projects

## AI Safety
I'm participating in the AGI Safety Fundamentals programme, where I explore AI safety research with fellow interested students. I am also a member of the recently founded AI Safety Initiative Amsterdam ([AISIA](https://aisafetyamsterdam.com/))


## Conformal Prediction
[My thesis](/assets/share/BScThesis_DerckPrinzhorn.pdf) benchmarked various adaptive conformal prediction methods for time series. I am very interested in reliability through uncertainty quantification and therefore working on another project related to conformal prediction.

## Autonomous robot soccer
After the covid pandemic, a few friends and I restored and renewed the robotics soccer student team. The tech lead and I, as a project manager, created vision and an operational plan to reach our goals. We have a very ambitious team and our team has seen explosive growth, increasing 5x in size. Currently, I'm more focused on the foundation board tasks and reinforcement learning (RL). We are working on making simulated RL generalizable to real robot soccer. More information can be found at our website [www.dutchnaoteam.nl](https://dutchnaoteam.nl).
