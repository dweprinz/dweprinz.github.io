Hey, my name is Derck and I'm currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligene (AI) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). Next to this, I work as a Machine Learning architect. I am interested in AI Safety, Conformal Prediction and EdTech. 


In 2020 I started my Bachelor's in AI at the UvA. Next to studying, I worked as a Teaching Assistant at the UvA, as a software engineer at LeerLevels and became active in our robotics student team: Dutch Nao Team. My bachelor thesis was about uncertainty quantification in which I benchmarked various adaptive conformal prediction methods for time series. For more information, take a look at my [cv](./assets/share/cv_derckprinzhorn.pdf).
