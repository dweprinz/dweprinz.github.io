# About me
Hi, welcome to my website!

My name is Derck and I'm currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligene (AI) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). Next to this, I work as a Machine Learning architect at the Dutch Police. I am very interested in AI Safety, Conformal Prediction and EdTech. In order to contribute to these fields I work on various [projects](_pages/projects.md).


In 2020 I started my Bachelor's in AI at the UvA. Next to studying, I worked as a Teaching Assistant at the UvA, as a software engineer at LeerLevels and became active in our robotics student team: Dutch Nao Team. My bachelor thesis was about uncertainty quantification in which I benchmarked various adaptive conformal prediction methods for time series. For more information, take a look at my [cv](../assets/share/cv_derckprinzhorn.pdf).
