# About me
Hi, welcome to my website!

My name is Derck and I'm currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligene (AI) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). Next to this, I work as a Machine Learning architect at the Dutch Police. I am very interested in AI Safety, Conformal Prediction and EdTech. 


In 2020 I started my Bachelor's in AI at the UvA. Next to studying, I worked as a Teaching Assistant at the UvA, as a software engineer at LeerLevels and became active in our robotics student team: Dutch Nao Team. My bachelor thesis was about uncertainty quantification in which I benchmarked various adaptive conformal prediction methods for time series. For more information, take a look at my [cv](../assets/share/cv_derckprinzhorn.pdf).

# Current projects

## Responsible AI
A large part of my week is spent on responsible AI. At my job this is one of my main topics of interest. Outside of work I also work on responsible AI, mainly by reading blogs and papers. I primarily focus on AI in possible high-risk settings, such as policing, defense and education.

## AI Safety
I have participated in the AGI Safety Fundamentals programme 2023, where I explored AI safety research with fellow interested students. I am currently a member of the recently founded AI Safety Initiative Amsterdam ([AISIA](https://aisafetyamsterdam.com/)). Recently I participated in an AI Safety Hackathon in Delft.


## Conformal Prediction
[My thesis](/assets/share/BScThesis_DerckPrinzhorn.pdf) ([code](https://github.com/dweprinz/Benchmarking-conformal-prediction-methods-for-time-series-regression)) benchmarked various adaptive conformal prediction methods for time series. In November 2023, I even won the AmsterdamAI Thesis Award 2023! I had the pleasure to be supervised by [Alexander Timans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-timans/) who introduced me to the topic of uncertainty quantification (UQ). I'm very interested in reliability through UQ and planning to work on another project related to conformal prediction.

## Autonomous robot soccer
After the covid pandemic, together with friends I renewed the robotics soccer student team. I operated as project manager and created vision and an operational plan to reach our goals. We now have a very ambitious team which has seen explosive growth, increasing 6x in size. Currently, I'm more focused on the foundation board tasks and reinforcement learning (RL). We are working on making simulated RL generalizable to real robot soccer. More information can be found at our website [www.dutchnaoteam.nl](https://dutchnaoteam.nl). We are looking for partners that support us in our mission to innovate in the robotics community and educate students about AI and robotics!
